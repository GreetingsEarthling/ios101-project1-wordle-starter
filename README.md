## Notes

I found myself having to review a lot of Swift's syntax and built in functions in order to complete this project. I read over documenation and watched quick youtube tutorials to catch myself up to speed. It felt challenging having to modify code that wasn't written by me at first, but as time passed I got used to the flow.
